            <b>For younger Millennials and Gen Z,</b> the internet and online shopping have always been a part of their lives. Starting with Pizza Hut launching the very first online shopping platform in the <em>United States</em> in 1994 (followed closely
            behind by Amazon and eBay), these kids have never known a world where every product wasn’t at their fingertips. It seems natural now that we buy from the comfort of our own homes.

            For those same folks who are just stepping out on their own and getting ready to furnish their first place, they will naturally turn to the internet for all of their furniture needs. But furniture was actually one of the last products to be successfully
            sold online. This is especially true of seating. The sofa is one of the biggest expenses when decking out a new place and customers want to try it out before purchasing. Even when you can complete the sale online, many older generations still
            want to experience sitting in, touching, and looking at a sofa or armchair in person before committing to buying it.

                Offering online-only shopping, Article created a direct-to-consumer program that cut out showrooms, thereby cutting a major cost associated with furniture prices. But would people really be willing to buy seating they couldn’t sit on first? The answer
                is a big ‘yes’. <strong>Since its founding in 2013,</strong> Article has sold its stylish pieces to over half a million customers throughout the United States and Canada.

            One of the keys to the company’s success has been a combination of high-end style and quality at affordable prices. By working directly with manufacturers and keeping other departments like warehousing and distribution in-house, the folks at Article built
            a sustainable online-only furniture company that has since become a blueprint for other brands that have followed.
